# Simon-Says
Recreate the classic game of simon using Javascript, jQuery, and an SVG of the classic game.

Adobe Illustrator was used to design an SVG of the classic game Simon Says. Using Javascript to handle the heart of the game and jQuery to interact with the SVG that was created. This project and repo is a work in progress. 

  - The text file is the SVG code output from Adobe Illustrator.
  - The HTML file is the sample webpage for testing in the browser with Javascript.
  - The Javascript file contains most of the code. It works right now but there is a timing issue that prevents it from running as intended.
